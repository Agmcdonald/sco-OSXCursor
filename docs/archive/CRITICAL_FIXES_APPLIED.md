# Critical Fixes Applied - iPad Gestures

**Date:** November 9, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed - Ready for Testing

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. iOS Platform Guards Added ✅
**Problem:** Swipe detection was running on macOS too  
**Fix:** Added `#if os(iOS)` around swipe logic in ComicPageView  
**Result:** Swipes only trigger on iOS/iPad devices

### 2. SpreadView Swipe Callbacks ✅
**Problem:** 2-page spread mode had no swipe support  
**Fix:** Added `onSwipeLeft/onSwipeRight` callbacks to SpreadView and wired them up  
**Result:** Swipe now works in spread mode

### 3. Per-Book Settings Respected ✅
**Problem:** Global settings overrode individual book preferences  
**Fix:** Changed to use `effectiveTransition(for: comic)` instead of `pageTransition`  
**Result:** Book-specific transitions now work correctly

### 4. Gesture Priority Fixed ✅
**Problem:** Magnification gesture might have blocked drag  
**Fix:** Changed to `.simultaneousGesture()` for both gestures  
**Result:** Zoom and drag work together properly

## 🧪 Test These Now

On your iPad:

1. **Swipe left/right** → Should navigate pages ✅
2. **Pinch zoom** → Should zoom in/out ✅  
3. **Drag when zoomed** → Should pan ✅
4. **2-page spread mode** → Billy Bunny should open ✅
5. **Per-book settings** → Custom transition should apply ✅

---

## Why These Fixes Work

### iOS Guards
```swift
#if os(iOS)
// Swipe detection only on iOS
if dx <= -threshold { onSwipeLeft() }
#endif
```
macOS doesn't need swipe (has arrow keys), and this prevents macOS-specific issues.

### SpreadView Callbacks
```swift
ComicPageView(
    page: spread.leftPage,
    onSwipeLeft: onSwipeLeft,    // ← Now wired up!
    onSwipeRight: onSwipeRight
)
```
Every page in spread mode can now trigger navigation.

### Effective Transition
```swift
private var effectiveTransition: PageTransition {
    settings.effectiveTransition(for: comic)  // ← Uses book's preference if set
}
```
Checks comic.preferredTransition first, falls back to global default.

## Quick Test

Build and run on iPad:
1. Open Billy Bunny
2. Try swiping → should work now
3. Try zooming → should work now
4. Switch to spread mode → should work now

**All critical issues should be resolved!** 🎉
