## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Swipes still don't work
**Check:**

- Is the swipe >50 points? (Not too small)

### Issue: Taps don't toggle controls
**Check:**
- Are you tapping empty space? (Not buttons)
- Try tapping near center of page
- Make sure controls aren't stuck visible

### Issue: Can't pan when zoomed
**Check:**
- Are you fully zoomed in? (Pinch out first)
- Try dragging in different directions
- Double-tap to zoom 2x, then try

### Issue: Buttons don't work
